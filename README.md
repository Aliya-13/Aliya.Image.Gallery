Description: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the Interactive Web Calculator is an easy-to-use web application. This project showcases a simple, responsive design that makes basic arithmetic operations a breeze to complete.

Important characteristics:

Basic Operators (+, -, *, /), Essential Functions (C for clear, = for equals), and Digits (0â€“9) are represented by a grid of buttons on the calculator's simple user interface.

Responsive Design: The calculator is responsive, meaning it works well on desktop and mobile devices, thanks to its CSS styling.

Real-time Calculations: The primary functionality is handled by JavaScript, which enables real-time calculations while users work with the calculator. Results and user inputs are promptly updated on the display.

Basic error handling to handle invalid actions is included in error handling.
